## Usage
A list of 30 random candidates will display, allowing you to add them to the potential candidates list or reject them immediately. Navigate to the potential candidates page to see if you want to reach out to them or reject them as well.
## Credits
This was created with the help of EdX starter code. I built out the pages & components, but much of the CSS styling was done beforehand (with adjustments).
## License
This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT License.
## Features
I would like to find a way to display the potential candidates better, such as a table or grid pattern.
## Contributing
Download the repo locally and give it a try! Be sure to give proper credit.
## Tests
No
